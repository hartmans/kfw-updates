<H1> Forget Saved Principals </H1>
<p>
Kerberos saves your principals for you if you select "Remember this principal" in the Get Ticket window.  Saved principals then auto-complete when you start to type them and are available from a list in the Get Ticket and Change Password windows.</p>
<p>
If you have saved a principal that you will no longer use, and you do not want that principal to auto-complete or appear in the saved principal list, tell Kerberos to forget your saved principals.
</p>

 <p>
<b>Note: </b>When you select Forget Principals, Kerberos forgets <em>all</em> of your saved principals. It is not possible to forget some principals while remembering others.
</p>
