Renewing your tickets allows you to run batch jobs without interruption and to work through a long session without continually reentering your password. Each time you renew your ticket, Kerberos resets the ticket lifetime to the length of the orginal ticket. </p>
<p>
You can renew a ticket if the following conditions are met:
<ul>
<li> When you obtained the ticket, the Renewable flag was selected. <a href="HTML/Ticket_Settings.htm">Ticket Settings and Flags help</a></li>
<li> The "Renewable Until" deadline has not been reached. </li>
<li> The ticket has not already expired. </li>
</ul>

Click the Renew Ticket button in the Home tab. Your  renewable ticket(s) will be renewed with the same lifespan as the original ticket(s). The ticket can now be used until the new time listed in the "Valid Until" column.

Your Kerberos tickets will now automatically be renewed until the renewable lifetime of the tickets is reached. However, this feature only works while Leash is active and running. This means that if your machine is in hibernation mode or if Leash is not running when it is time to renew your tickets, your tickets will not be renewed. </p>

<p>
In the View section of the Home tab, click the Renewable Until checkbox. The Renewable Until column will appear. You can renew your ticket repeatedly until the date and time in this column is reached.
