<H1>Import Status </H1>
<p>
The Import Status column in the main window shows whether tickets were obtained with the Get Ticket function in  Kerberos for Windows or if they were obtained by a Windows Logon session when you logged on to a domain, and whether they have been imported or exported to the other application.  </p>
<p>
Use the Import Status checkbox in the View section of the menu to show or hide the column. <a href="HTML/View_Menu.htm">Using the View menu </a></p>

<table>
<tr><th> Import Status </th>
<th>Meaning</th>

<tr>
<th id="th2">imported</th> 
<td>The tickets were obtained when you started a Windows Logon session by logging in to a domain.
<p></p>
They have been imported into Kerberos for Windows. </td>

</tr><tr>
<th id="th2">importable</th> 
<td>The tickets were obtained when you started a Windows Logon session  by logging in to a domain.
<p></p>
They have not been imported into Windows for Kerberos because Automatic Import has been turned off. To import them, select Automatic Import in the Options menu or Import in the More menu.<br>

</tr><tr>
<th id="th2">protected</th> 
<td>The tickets were obtained when you started a Windows Logon session  by logging in to a domain.
<p></p>
They have not been imported into Windows for Kerberos because User Access Control (UAC) in Windows is preventing that action. If you want to allow the tickets  to be imported, turn off your computer's UAC. </td>

</tr><tr>
<th id="th2">exportable</th> 
<td> You used the Get Ticket window to obtain these tickets.
<p></p>
They have not been exported, so if you are logged into a Windows domain, you have separate tickets that were obtained by your Windows Logon session. 
<p></p>
To use these tickets with your Windows Logon session, click the Export Ticket button. Note that exporting your tickets replaces rather than adds to any existing tickets for the Windows domain. </td>

</tr><tr>
<th id="th2">exported</th> 
<td>You used the Get Ticket window to obtain these tickets.
<p></p>
They have been exported into your Windows Logon session and can be used with your Windows domain. </td>
