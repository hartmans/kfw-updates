<h2> <a name="using-view-options">Using the View Options Panel</a></h2>
<p>
Click the Options tab at the top of the ribbon menu and look to the
left to find the View Options panel. The View Options are a list of all
of the ticket information columns that can be displayed in the main
window.</p>
<p>
Select a checkbox to show the information column in the main window.
Deselect it to hide the column. Some options are selected by default.
For example, "Valid Until" is selected by default, so the main window
shows the Valid Until column showing when your tickets will expire. <br>
