 <h1><a name="top">About Tickets</a></h1>
<p>
The MIT Kerberos program helps you manage your Kerberos tickets. Click
the Get Ticket button and enter your principal (your Kerberos identity)
and password to obtain a ticket. The ticket allows you to securely
access all of the computers and services set up to authenticate you
through Kerberos, until the ticket expires, without requiring you to
enter your password again. </p>
<p> If you have logged on to a Windows domain, you already have a
Kerberos ticket. This ticket is marked in the main window with an
Import Status of <em>imported,</em> <em>importable,</em> or <em>protected.</em>

protocol behind the scenes to authenticate you when you log on to a

Some applications that use Kerberos accept tickets issued through a
Windows Logon session. Others need to use the MIT Kerberos interface.
In most installations, MIT Kerberos will attempt to automatically
import any tickets already issued to you. Imported tickets can take
full advantage of the MIT Kerberos interface. <p></p>

automatically renewed until you exit your Windows Logon session. </td>
