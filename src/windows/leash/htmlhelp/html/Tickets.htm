<p>
The Kerberos for Windows program helps you manage your  Kerberos tickets.  Click the Get Ticket  button and enter your principal (your Kerberos identity) and password to obtain a ticket. The ticket allows you to securely access all of the computers and services set up to authenticate you through Kerberos, until the ticket expires, without requiring you to enter your password again. <br>
<a href="HTML/Get_Tickets.htm">How to get tickets</a>
 </p>
<p>
 If you have logged on to a Windows domain, you already have a Keberos ticket. This ticket is marked in the main window with an Import Status of "imported," "importable," or "protected."

<tr><th colspan="2"><a name="importable">Importable (Windows domain) Tickets </a> </th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Most Windows operating systems use the Kerberos protocol behind the scenes to authenticate you when you  log on to a Windows domain with a Windows Logon session. This means that if you have logged on to a Windows domain (not just to your computer), Windows probably issued you a Kerberos ticket. 
<p></p>
Some applications that use Kerberos accept tickets issued through a Windows Logon session. Others need to use the Kerberos for Windows interface. In most installations,  Kerberos for Windows will attempt to automatically import any tickets already issued to you. Imported tickets can take full advantage of the Kerberos for Windows interface. 
<p></p>
Windows domain tickets obtained through your Windows Logon session are automatically renewed until you exit your Windows Logon session.
 </td>
<tr> <th id="th2">Import Status</th>
<td>If you have tickets obtained through a  Windows Logon session, the main window of Kerberos for Windows shows the Import Status for all of your tickets. You can hide or show this column with the View panel checkboxes. Tickets originally obtained through a Windows Logon session are <em> imported</em> or <em>importable</em> to Kerberos for Windows, or they are <em>protected</em> from being imported. <br>
