 <H1>About Tickets</H1>
<p>
The Leash program helps you manage your  <a href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(popupTicket, popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">Kerberos tickets</a>.  Kerberos tickets  allow you to securely access all of the computers and services set up to use your Kerberos password  without having to enter your password each time. </p>
<p>
 If your Windows Logon Session uses Keberos for authentication, you can import your existing ticket into Leash instead of using Leash to get a new ticket.</p>


<H2>Ticket expiration</H2>
<p>Your tickets are valid for a set amount of time. The Leash window includes a <b>Valid Until</b> column. After the time listed in this column, the ticket will expire and you will no longer be able to use it to access network resources until you get a new ticket. Usually tickets are valid for around the length of a work day (e.g., 8 hours). In some configurations, you can customize the lifespan of your ticket when you obtain it, within the restrictions set up by your administrator.</p>

<H2>Renewable tickets </H2>
<p>When you get your ticket, you have the option to make the ticket renewable. You can renew these tickets without entering your password until the renewal time limit is reached.
<p>
However, if you let the tickets expire, you cannot renew them  even if you are still in the renewable time frame. Usually the renewable lifespan is several days, but this setting can be changed when you obtain your ticket. The Leash window can be set to display a <b>Renewable Until</b> column for your tickets to help you keep track of the ticket lifespan. </p>
