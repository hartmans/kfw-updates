<H1>Encryption Types</H1>
<p>
Kerberos supports several types of encryption for the session key and the ticket. The type used for a particular ticket or session key depends on a combination of your operating system,  the configuration of your Kerberos installation, and the configuration and capabilities of the particular network resources you are accessing. 
</p>
<p>
Some encryption types that are still supported are now considered weak and therefore undesirable. However, they are still supported to allow Kerberos to be used in a network that contains some older machines running operating systems that  do not support the newer encryption types.</p>
<H2>View Encryption Types</H2>
In the View section of the menu, select Encryption Type to open that column. The column will show the encryption type associated with each of your tickets and session keys.

  <td>   The DES (Data Encryption Standard) family is a symmetric block cipher. It was designed to handle only 56-bit keys which is not enough for modern computing power.  It is now considered to be weak encryption.   <ul id="helpul">
