<H1> Manage Multiple Principals </H1>
<p>
If you have multiple principals, several features in Kerberos for Windows will help you manage them. You can save multiple principals after entering them in the Get Ticket window. You can then choose from the list of saved principals when you get tickets or change your password.</p>
<p>
All of your principals with tickets are listed in the main window. The default principal is in bold font.

When you get tickets for a principal for the first time, enter the principal in the Principal field of the Get Ticket window. Select the "Remember this principal" checkbox to add the principal to a list. The next time you get tickets or change your password, you can select the appropriate principal from the list or enter a new one.  </td></tr>

<tr>
<th id="th2">Select principal before using buttons</th>
<td>
Select a principal in the main window by clicking it. The selected principal will now be affected by the buttons in the ribbon menu (e.g., Change Password, Export). Note that you can select multiple principals to use with the Renew Tickets button. 

</td></tr>
<tr>
<th id="th2">Renew tickets </th>

If the Automatic Ticket Renewal option is selected, all renewable tickets for all principals are renewed automatically. To renew tickets just for some principals, click the principal(s) with tickets you want to renew in the main window, then click the Renew Ticket button. 
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th id="th2">Choose default principal</th>

To choose which principal's tickets are used by default when you access a Kerberized service, select a principal in the main window by clicking it and then click the Make Default button. <a href="HTML/Make_Default.htm">Click for details</a></td>
</tr>
<th id="th2">Delete saved principals</th>
<td>
If you have saved a principal that you will no longer use, and you do not want that principal to autocomplete or show in the saved principal list in the Get Ticket and Change Password windows, click Forget Principals in the More panel. Note that this will make Kerberos forget <em>all</em> of your saved principals.  </td></tr>
