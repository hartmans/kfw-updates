<H1>About Passwords</H1>
<P>
Kerberos offers strong and reliable security for computers and network systems that use it for authentication, but  it is only as secure as the password you choose. A weak password can jeopardize not only your privacy and information, but also any computers or networks that you access with that password.</P>
<H2>Choosing a Password</H2>
<p>
Create a strong password that is not a word found in the dictionary or based on easily available information about yourself. Usually the easiest way to do that is to start with a phrase, not a word. 
For best security choose a unique password that you have not used with any other application.That way if one application is somehow hacked or compromised, the damage is limited to that application. <a href="HTML/Password_Tips.htm">Password Tips</a></P>

<H2>Maintaining Your Password</H2>
<p>
 If you ever suspect that your password has been compromised, change it immediately. It's a good idea occasionally change your password even if you think it is still secure. This habit can limit the damage if your password is compromised without your knowledge.</P>
