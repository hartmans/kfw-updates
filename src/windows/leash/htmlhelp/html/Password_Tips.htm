<p>
A strong password is a mix of lower case letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and is at least 8 characters long. </p>
<p>
A strong password is <b>not</b> based on a word found in the dictionary or any easily discovered information about yourself. </p>
<p>
To create a strong password that is still easy to remember, try starting with a phrase or sentence. For example, <font id="typed"> Beans and rice are my favorite foods</font> or  <tt>Mary had a little lamb</tt>. Then play around with symbols, shorthands, and misspellings to make it more secure. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>Beans&ricearemyFavoriteFoods!</tt></li>
<li><tt>Rbeans&ricemyfavoritefoods?</tt> ("Are rice and beans my favorite foods?")</li>
<li><tt>Beans 'n' rice R my fav f00ds!</tt></li>
<li><tt>B&RaremyFaveF00ds</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>
Do <b>not</b> base your password on any of the following. They are far too easy to guess (even if you spell them backwards).</p>
<ul>
<li>Any names, including yours or that of your parents, children, pets, friends, characters from popular media, etc.</li>
<li> Your phone number, address, birthday, etc.</li>
<li>Your social security, drivers license, or license plate numbers. </li>
<li> One or two words found in a dictionary.</li>
<li> The phrases "Let me in," "open up," or something similar.</li>
<li> Simple patterns like "lolololololo" or "12345678." </li>
</ul>
